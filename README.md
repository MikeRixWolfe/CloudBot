# CloudBot

CloudBot is a simple, fast, expandable open-source Python IRC Bot!

## Getting CloudBot

This branch has diverged from the upstream.

## Installing CloudBot

Firstly, CloudBot will only run on **Python 3.5.3 or higher**

To install CloudBot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](docs/installing/nix.md)

To install CloudBot on Windows, see [here](docs/installing/win.md)


### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.json.default` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3 -m cloudbot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3 CloudBot/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.
